philosophy
- find 10x leverage
- keep it simple
- good = f(effective, efficient)

tools
- mostly python and typescript
- cloud services for compute, storage, inference, and observability
- agent-native engineering (engineer-led for complex work, background agents for basic tasks)

interests
- ai applications, agents and multi-agent systems, models and training 
- embedded systems and lower-level languages (Rust, C/C++)
- novel human-computer interfaces (tactile, AR, voice)
